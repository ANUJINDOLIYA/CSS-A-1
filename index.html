     <h2 class="container2">What is CSS ?</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML,elements are to be displayed on screen paper,on in other media.</li>
        <li>
            <span class="itemDeco">CSS is not necessary</span>
            <span class="itemcolor">CSS saves a lot of work </span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li><span class="itemitelic">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</span></li>
     </ol>
     <h3 class="container">CSS Can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways</h3>
    <ul class="listcontainer">
        <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements 1</li>
        <li>Internal-by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External-by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file </li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files-however
            ,<span class="itemcolor1">in this tutorials we will use inline and internal styles</span>-because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph">When comparing CSS class vs ID the difference is that CSS class  applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript. </p>
    <p class="paragraph2">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>
    <p class="itemitelic1">There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
